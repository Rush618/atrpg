Another Text RPG

This game was created by Rush Deeter with creative
help from Kathy Orta. Work began September 9, 2020 
after watching the YouTube video by Bryan Tong. The
link for the video can be found below.

If you find yourself struggling to learn the commands,
try reading the "AcceptableLists" file. While all of 
these words are not always accepted, most of them
are, most of the time.

If you have any questions, notice any bugs, or have
suggestions on how to imp[rove the code or the
gameplay experience, feel  free to email me at:
